## Key Insights  

### Contract Type and Churn  
- **Month-to-Month Contracts**: 42% churn rate (highest).  
- **One-Year Contracts**: 11% churn rate.  
- **Two-Year Contracts**: 3% churn rate (lowest).  
- **Takeaway**: Longer-term contracts reduce churn significantly, making them a valuable retention strategy.  

### Payment Methods and Churn  
- **Electronic Checks**: 45% churn rate (highest).  
- **Credit Cards, Bank Transfers, and Mailed Checks**: 15–18%.  
- **Takeaway**: Customers using electronic checks are more likely to churn. Campaigns encouraging secure and convenient payment options can reduce this.  

### Churn by Tenure

- **Tenure 1–3 Years**: 35%.  
- **Tenure > 3 Years**: 15%.  
- **Takeaway**: The first year is critical for customer retention. Improved early engagement strategies can help lower churn.  

### Churn by Internet Service Type  
- **Fiber Optic Customers**: 30% churn rate.  
- **DSL Customers**: 20% churn rate.  
- **Takeaway**: Fiber optic customers are churning more, potentially due to dissatisfaction with service quality or increased competition.
